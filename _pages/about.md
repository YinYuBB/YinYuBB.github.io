I'm a postgraduate student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/). I am also currently doing a remote research intern at School of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science of [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Qingyu Chen](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/qingyu-chen/).

My academic focus is on biomedical text mining and information retrieval, multimodal analysis of large language models, and artificial intelligence-assisted biomedical applications.
